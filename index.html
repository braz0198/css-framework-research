        1. Bootstrap 5 is a popular and widely-used CSS framework that simplifies web development by providing a comprehensive set of pre-designed components, styles, and utilities. It is an open-source toolkit that helps developers create responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications with ease. Bootstrap 5 introduced several notable changes and improvements compared to its predecessor, Bootstrap 4.
        In Bootstrap 5, the framework has been made more lightweight by removing jQuery dependency, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. It also incorporates an updated and more modern design system, with enhanced typography, spacing, and colour schemes. The grid system has been refined to provide greater flexibility and control over layout design.
        Additionally, Bootstrap 5 continues to offer a wide range of UI components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and modals, making it an excellent choice for developers seeking to streamline their front-end development process and ensure a consistent and visually appealing user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Overall, Bootstrap 5 is a powerful tool for building responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications, with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and performance.
